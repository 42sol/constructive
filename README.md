#constructive library/framework for opensccad
A dialect of OpenScad suitable for complex models,
with very many new features. It has been in continous use by myself for many years now.

Compiles directly by Openscad.
Just include constructive-compiled.scad
in your file that is all.

still work in progress but very usable and imho essential
see Examples pulley-demo.scad for how to use it
